# Horserace chart
A simple charting template to plot changing rank in a group of competitors over time. Useful for showing the changing fortunes of candidates in elections, football teams, etc.

## Data requirements
Each row after the header row should be a participant in the race â€“ such as a politician or team. There should be a column for the participant's name, and multiple columns for the 'stages' in the race (week, day, hours, etc). Each stage is plotted at an equal width on the chart.
