# Horserace chart
A visualisation template for use on [Flourish](https://flourish.studio). Provides line and “bump” modes, and features such as images for each line.

## Getting started
Clone the repo and run in the [Flourish SDK](https://flourish.studio/developers/quickstart/).

NOTE: if you are not a Flourish team member, you’ll need remove `devDependencies` and `precommit` from `package.json`, as these refer to a private NPM module.
