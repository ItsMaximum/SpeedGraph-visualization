# Horserace chart
A simple charting template for plotting changing rank in a group of competitors over time. Useful for showing the changing fortunes of candidates in elections, football team, etc.

## Usage
Each row must be a timeslice (week, day, etc). Each timeslice is plotted at an equal width. Use the column selectors to point to one column for the name of the timeslice, and two or more columns for the ranks of the “horses”.
