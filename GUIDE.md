This template is ideal for showing the changing fortunes of candidates in elections, football teams, etc. It provides two modes, and allows you to animate between them: a line chart, which plots the raw values in the data, and a “bump” chart, which computes and plots the ranks.

## Data requirements
Each row after the header row should be a participant in the race – such as a politician or team. There should be a column for the participant’s name, and multiple columns for the “stages” in the race (week, day, hours, etc). Each stage is plotted at an equal width on the x axis.

## Tips
* You can add a photo or image for each competitor by putting the URL of an image file in the relevant column in the spreadsheet. Use small images to avoid loading delays.
* In the settings panel, you can decide whether to show scores or ranks, or to reveal buttons to let the viewer see both.
* In the Flourish story editor, try clicking on the axis labels to show different stages of the race in different slides.
